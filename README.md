## ⚠️ Album Generator Script

This project includes a script to generate album data:

```bash
npm run generate
```

### What it does

* Scans `/public/music`
* Generates album + track structure
* Updates `albums.json`

---

### ⚠️ Important Notes (READ THIS)

* Running this script will **modify `albums.json`**
* New tracks will default to **local file paths**:

  ```
  /music/AlbumName/track.mp3
  ```

---

### ☁️ Cloudinary Workflow

This app uses Cloudinary for production audio.

After running the generator:

1. Open:

   ```
   public/data/albums.json
   ```
2. Find newly added tracks
3. Replace their `src` values with Cloudinary URLs
4. Save and commit

---

### 🚨 Warning

Do NOT rely on the generator for:

* Final `src` values (Cloudinary)
* Manual edits inside `albums.json`

Always verify before deploying.
